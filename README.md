# Currently working on
- Summarizing the points from articles included in bibliography

# TODO
3) Find articles with alternatives to p-values / CI's?
4) Find references for p-values in "table 1"'s and why one should not do that
5) Ideally it would be possible to use the same bibliography file for both the notes and slides. Figure out if
   this is possible.
